# SYK-numerics
Numerics to solve the SYK model

The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a quantum mechanical model of interest in the study of quantum gravity. The model consists of N fermions with random interactions. This code computes the two point function and entropy of the model at different temperatures. At finite N it does this by diagonalising the Hamiltonian and at infinite N it does this by numerically solving the Schwinger-Dyson equations.
